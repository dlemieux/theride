You are in front of the line for the |rChimera|n! A holographic display forms an archway above the start of the queue. It shifts every few minutes, forming different potential scenarios you might experience on the ride. It's amazing that these friendly |rChimeras|n are willing to be ridden by thrill-seeking guests!

If you dare to enter, you should get in line. Looking at the nearby safety information or the wait time display could also be useful.
